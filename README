Lazy 4.3 distribution

The Lazy documentation, including the installation instructions, is
in the doc directory

This distribution includes a version of theTomcat server developed
by the Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org),
read the license in tomcat/LICENSE.

Lazy is known to work with more recent versions of Tomcat that
can be freely downloaded from the Apache site.

This distribution also includes a version of the HSQL database
engine (http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net), read the licence in hsqldb/hsqldb_lic.txt

Although Lazy is distributed with HSQLDB, which is a small and nice
100% Java database engine, it has been tested with Oracle, Access, and
Postgres. It should work with any relational database system accessible
through a JDBC driver.
